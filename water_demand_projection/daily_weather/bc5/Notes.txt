I. 	Terms of Use

These projections are being distributed to interested users for consideration
in research and planning applications. Such applications may include any
project carried out by an individual or organized by a university, a
scientific institute, public agency, or private sector entity for research or
planning purposes. Any decision to use these projections is at the interested
user's discretion and subject to the Disclaimer provided below.

II. 	Disclaimer

These projections are being made available to provide immediate access for the
convenience of interested persons. They are being made available by Archive
Collaborators (i.e. Bureau of Reclamation, Climate Analytics Group, Climate
Central, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Santa Clara University,
Scripps Institution of Oceanography, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and U.S.
Geological Survey. Archive Collaborators believe the information to be correct
representations of potential high-resolution climate/hydrologic variations and
changes subject to the limitations of the CMIP3 and CMIP5 global climate
simulations, and the downscaling methods and their limitations, as described
elsewhere in this web site. However, human and mechanical errors remain
possibilities. Therefore, Archive Collaborators do not guarantee the accuracy,
completeness, timeliness, or correct sequencing of the information. Also,
neither Archive Collaborators, nor any of the sources of the information shall
be responsible for any errors or omissions, or for the use or results obtained
from the use of this information.

III. Acknowledgements and Citation of these Projections

Whenever you publish research based on projections from this archive, please
include two acknowledgements:

1. First, acknowledge the superceding effort.
   a. For CMIP3, the following is language suggested by the CMIP3 archive hosts at
      PCMDI: "We acknowledge the modeling groups, the Program for Climate Model
      Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI) and the WCRP's Working Group on Coupled
      Modelling (WGCM) for their roles in making available the WCRP CMIP3
      multi-model dataset. Support of this dataset is provided by the Office of
      Science, U.S. Department of Energy." PCMDI also requests that in first making
      reference to the projections from this archive, please first reference the
      CMIP3 dataset by including the phrase "the World Climate Research Programme's
      (WCRP's) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3) multi-model
      dataset". Subsequent references within the same publication might refer to the
      CMIP3 data with terms such as "CMIP3 data", "the CMIP3 multi-model dataset",
      "the CMIP3 archive", or the "CMIP3 dataset".

   b. For CMIP5, , the model output should be referred to as "the CMIP5 multi-model
      ensemble [archive/output/results/of simulations/dataset/ ...]". In
      publications, you should include a table (referred to below as Table XX)
      listing the models and institutions that provided model output used in your
      study. In this table and as appropriate in figure legends, you should use the
      CMIP5 “official” model names found in "CMIP5 Modeling Groups and their Terms
      if Use" (pdf document, also in Word doc format). In addition, an
      acknowledgment similar to the following should be included in your
      publication:

        “We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on
        Coupled Modelling, which is responsible for CMIP, and we thank the climate
        modeling groups (listed in Table XX of this paper) for producing and making
        available their model output. For CMIP the U.S. Department of Energy's Program
        for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison provides coordinating support
        and led development of software infrastructure in partnership with the Global
        Organization for Earth System Science Portals.”

    where, “Table XX” in your paper should list the models and modeling groups
    that provided the data you used. In addition it may be appropriate to cite one
    or more of the CMIP5 experiment design articles listed on the CMIP5 reference
    page.

2. Second, generally acknowledge this archive as "Downscaled CMIP3 and CMIP5
Climate and Hydrology Projections" archive at
http://gdo-dcp.ucllnl.org/downscaled_cmip_projections/. To reference specific
information in the archive, you may also use the following references:

    b. (for reference to all BCSD and BCCA downscaled content, including CMIP3 and
        CMIP5), you can reference the technical memorandum
        [http://gdo-dcp.ucllnl.org/downscaled_cmip_projections/techmemo/[FILENAME]].
